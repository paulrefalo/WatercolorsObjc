<H1>Primary Colors</h1>
The idea behind Primary colors is that a large variety of colors can be achieved by combining a small number of basic colors. There are 4 main sets of primaries depending on the application. RGB for projected light or electronic displays, CMYK for printing, RYB for painting.

The basic idea is you can combine the primary colors to get a secondary color.

Red + Yellow is Orange.

Yellow + Blue is Green .

Blue + Red is Violet.

Paint is made from pigments that are not purely one of the primary colors.  A red paint may have more blue and be a cool red. Or it may have more yellow which is a warm red.
